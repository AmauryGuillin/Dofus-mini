# Dofus-mini

Hi! I'm a junior developer who's trying to get better at coding every day through various personal projects. Dofus is a game that holds a special place in my life, and for this reason I've decided to pay tribute to it by trying to recode the game in a very minimalist way and according to my own style.

# What to do in Dofus-mini

The game is simply a combat simulation between an Iop-class character and a Gobball-type monster. You can move around the field, attack and try to win against the wild Gobball that threatens you. Don't hesitate to take advantage of the magnificent music and sound effects offered by this little replica.
